          joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="font-medium text-[#48556a] leading-relaxed opacity-70 mt-4 text-xs"> ‚Äú Before joining the
          bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
          code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</blockquote>
